Steps for displaying project into url

Download zip file

Unzip file and move project folder to a newly created directory

The next step is to download all the node packages but before this can work, make sure that nodejs in installed.

Then from the terminal, cd into project directory and type npm install

After the download is complete, type npm run watch and this will start the dev server and you will be able to the URL provided.
This url is usual localhost:1234 or localhost:7382. The terminal will display which url project will load on.

***As of right now, this project doesn't have a backend attached to it. I will be building this soon. Sit tight and I will be done with that shortly***
